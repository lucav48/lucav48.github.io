## Welcome

I‚Äôm **Luca Virgili**, tenure-track researcher at the Department of Information Engineering, Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche (Italy).

My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Complex Networks**. I am particularly interested in understanding the behavior of interconnected systems and in developing machine learning models that are both interpretable and computationally efficient for real-world applications.

---

## Research Interests

- **Complex and Social Networks analysis** and modeling of online interactions
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and multilayer network models
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** in computer vision and social contexts
- **Efficient deep learning models**, including model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** applied across domains such as education, and content generation

My work is often interdisciplinary, spanning social media, education, cybersecurity, and human-centered AI.

## Projects

Below are some research highlights with potential real-world applications:

### üìä Interpretable Neural Networks
We modeled convolutional neural networks (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) as multilayer networks to understand and compress their structure.  
**Applications**: Model compression, visual explainability.

### üîç Social Influence and Behavior Prediction on Online Platforms
We used GNNs to detect key influencers and community evolution patterns in social media networks.  
**Applications**: Marketing strategy, content moderation, misinformation detection.

### üß† Efficient Vision Transformers via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation
Our approach improves the performance and interpretability of ViTs while reducing complexity.  
**Applications**: Embedded AI, edge computing, industrial automation.
