Welcome! I am a PostDoc Researcher at Polytechnic University of Marche. My research interests 
include Machine Learning, Complex Network and Social Network Analysis, and a bit of Internet of 
Things. I am an enthusiastic data scientist and curious about the novelties in the Artificial
Intelligence world.

Research
====
The main field of research is the analysis of Complex and Social Networks. The research activities involve the application of Complex Network Analysis and Social Network Analysis techniques to study different contexts. Modeling a problem using a graph representation allows to obtain interesting results in many fields such as the biomedical, the technological innovation, the Big Data, and the classic Social Networks.

Another research field of interest is the one regarding Artificial Intelligence. In this case, there are two different research topics. The former regards the application of Machine Learning models to the workspace environment. Specifically, a study of how Machine Learning can be used effectively in predicting user falls. The latter regards the so-called Explainable AI. Briefly, it consists of the explanation of the paths and the decisions made by a Machine Learning model to provide a particular answer w.r.t. an input. In this setting, he is actually investigating the possible interpretation of deep convolutional neural networks through the Complex Network Analysis and the Multiplex Networks. The aim of this research is to understand the deep network architecture thanks to the analysis of its relevant components, the exploration of patterns and features, the high-level representations and tracking of information flow which all of them could lead to the designing of more efficient and accurate architectures.

Finally, in the IoT context, a new field of research is the one called Multiple IoT (MIoT), which is a vision of the IoT as a set of subnets capable of interacting with each other through cross object. Several properties have been studied in this line of research, such as the definition and study of anomalies, the concept of scope, trust and reputation properties of smart objects and an approach to ensure user privacy.
