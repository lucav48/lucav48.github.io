Welcome! I am a Researcher Tenure-Track at Polytechnic University of Marche. My research interests 
include **Machine Learning**, **Complex Network and Social Network Analysis**. I am an enthusiastic data scientist and curious about the novelties in the Artificial
Intelligence world.

If you're interested in collaborating with me on research, feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn.

Research
====
My research focuses on **Complex and Social Networks**, using techniques from Complex Network Analysis and Social Network Analysis to study different scenarios. Through the graph representation, I have obtained valuable insights in fields such as deep learning, biomedical, and Social Networks.

My research in the field of Complex Networks has led me to investigate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using **multilayer networks**. Specifically, I have been developing a solution to represent CNNs such as VGG16 or ResNet50 as a multilayer network.

By using my mapping approach, I was able to create a method for **compressing CNN models** and removing unnecessary layers while still maintaining similar performance. I believe this mapping technique has potential for use in a variety of other tasks, and I plan to further explore these possibilities in the coming years.

Recently, I started studying **Graph Neural Networks** (GNNs) and exploring their potential applications in social network scenarios. GNNs are a variant of neural networks designed to work with graph-structured data, and they can be used for many different tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification.
